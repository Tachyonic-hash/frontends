      The OVM is one of the most exciting developments for Ethereum today. It tackles one of the biggest problems a
      project like ours has - how to empower users with near-instant trading and subsecond tick data. Optimism has
      consistently demonstrated their commitment to L1 compatability - both in terms of reusing our existing
      infrastructure and in connecting to other L1 services we rely on, such as The Graph.

      Imagine not needing to make any changes to your solidity smart contracts to have a DAPP work natively on an
      Ethereum L2 with security from Ethereum, massive scaling, no data availability issues, and synchronous
      interoperability with other DAPPs on L2.
